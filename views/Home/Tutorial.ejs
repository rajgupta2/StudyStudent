    <p>C language is structured(procedural) programming language, developed by
        Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972 BC.</p>
    <h4>Why is C imporatnt?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>C is a mother language of today's modern languange that is why
            everyone recommended to learn C firstly while starting to learn
            coding.</li>
        <li>It is high speed programming in execution.</li>
        <li>It is prortable language means it is not forced by any operating
            system.</li>
        <li>It is Wide Acceptable.</li>
        <li>Used for writing OS as well as application software.</li>

    <h4>Compiler</h4>
    <p>
        It is a translator which is used to translate the whole programming code
        to machine level (binary)language at a single time.<br />
        Ex-Turbo C, Dev C++ etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Interpreter</h4>
    <p>
        It is a translator which is used to translate the single line of

    <h4>Keywords</h4>
    <p>
        These are the reserved words in C which is not used as user defined
        word.These are used to write the statement(instruction).There are 32
        keywords in C language.<br>
        Ex- int,char,float,if,else etc.

    <h4>Introduction of HTML</h4>
    <p>
        HTML stands for<b> Hyper Text Markup Language</b> which is used
        for creating web page.
    </p>

            HTML is used to create webpages.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML standards are developed under the authority of the
            World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), headed by Tim Berners
            Lee.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML documents are simple text documents with .html or
            .htm extensions.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML uses many tags to make a webpage. So it is a tag based
            language.
        </li>
        <li>The tags of HTML are surrounded by <> (Angular Brackets). </li>
        <li>
            It have wide ranges of colors, objects and layouts.JQuery is a
            JavaScript library.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>History Of HTML</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            HTML was created by Tim Berners Lee in late 1991.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
            specification which was published in 1995.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was
            published in late 1999.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an
            extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was
            published in 2012.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Features of HTML</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> First advantage it is widely used.</li>
        <li> Every browser supports HTML language.</li>
        <li> Easy to learn and use.</li>
        <li>HTML and XML syntax is very similar.</li>
        <li> HTML is not case sensitive.</li>
        <li> HTML is free.</li>
        <li>
            It is by default in every Browser so you
            don't need to purchase extra software.

    </ol>
    <h4>Disadvantages of HTML</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>

            dynamic pages then HTML is not useful.
        </li>
        <li>Need to write lot of code for making simple webpage.</li>
        <li>Security features are not good in HTML.</li>
        <li>
            If we need to write long code for making a webpage
            then it produces some complexity.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Requirement for HTML</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b> Text Editor -</b> Notepad, Notepad++ etc.

    <h4>Its Features-</h4>
    <p>ASP.NET is a free web framework for building websites and web
        applications on .NET Framework using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ASP.NET
        MVC 5 is a web framework based on Model-View-Controller (MVC)
        architecture. Developers can build dynamic web applications using
        ASP.NET MVC framework that enables a clean separation of concerns, fast
        development, and TDD friendly.</p>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application
        into three components - Model, View, and Controller.
    </p>
    <p><b> Model:</b> Model represents the shape of the data. A class in C# is
        used to describe a model. Model objects store data retrieved from the
        database.</p>
    <p>
        Model represents the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>View:</b> View in MVC is a user interface. View display model data to
        the user and also enables them to modify them. View in ASP.NET MVC is
        HTML, CSS, and some special syntax (Razor syntax) that makes it easy to
        communicate with the model and the controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        View is the User Interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Controller:</b> The controller handles the user request. Typically,
        the user uses the view and raises an HTTP request, which will be handled
        by the controller. The controller processes the request and returns the
        appropriate view as a response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Controller is the request handler.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user enters a URL in the browser, it goes to the webserver and
        routed to a controller. A controller executes related view and models
        for that request and create the response and sends it back to the
        browser.
